/*
  Device enumeration for a namespace shared with another ioMemory driver.

  Every generation of this driver enumerates its cards from zero and registers
  them under the same names: /proc/<root>/fct<n>, /dev/fct<n> and /dev/fio<a>.
  Two generations loaded at once therefore collide on the first card, and the
  second driver to load fails to attach it.

  The numbers are generated inside the prebuilt driver object, which hands the
  finished names to this porting layer.  This file is the one place that
  renumbers them, so that the driver occupies a free range of the shared
  namespace instead of insisting on starting at zero.  The names themselves are
  never changed: userspace tools keep working unmodified, and the range in use
  is printed at load time rather than having to be inferred.
